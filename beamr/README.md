## Beamr

This is the package that I used to generate my slides. It's basically a
beamer theme that is based on KDE's Oxygen theme. The original theme from KDE
can be found [here](http://www.kde.org/kdeslides). I've just done some
polishing on top of KDE's theme. To use it just include the
`beamerthemebeamr.sty` package and also copy the `beamr-header.png` file. I'm
also providing an example in this repo named `example.pdf`.

Notice that there are plenty of cool themes out there for Beamer. For example,
take a look at this [modern approach](https://github.com/matze/mtheme).
